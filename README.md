## Overview

This project simulates UAV endurance and battery behavior step-by-step over time.  
It expands on the UAV Battery Efficiency Estimator to enable **interactive mission previews** and **timeline-based telemetry**.

---

## Features

- Real-time simulated battery draw  
- Adjustable power and duration inputs  
- Live telemetry-style feedback  
- Timeline progress bar  
- 100% Streamlit-compatible and mobile-ready

---

## Why It Matters

This tool makes it easier to:

- Predict mission risk
- Optimize UAV configurations
- Demonstrate AI-based decision tools in the field

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Time-based simulation core  
- [ ] Abort logic when battery runs low  
- [ ] Phase simulation: climb → cruise → descend  
- [ ] Map-based visual route playback  
- [ ] Terrain-aware simulation  
- [ ] Exportable logs or visual reports

---

## Preview

*Visual banner or simulation animation coming soon.*
